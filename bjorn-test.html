<h3>Does this link work?nope, </h3>
<h2>Erwin here here here here</h2>

    <a href="/proxy.jsp?http://services.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/?f=pjson">JSP test link</a> - seems like NO.
    Depending on your browser, "open in new tab" might or might not work...

<br/>
<br/>
    But if you copy/paste the same path http://dev00120:8080/proxytestcase1/proxy.jsp?http://services.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/?f=pjson then it seems to work.

    The only difference I can see is that the one that fail has a referrer.

Changes after john pull request: It also fails in an iframe, probably for same reason:<br/>
<iframe style="background:#DDD" src="http://localhost:9083/ATT2/proxy.jsp?http://services.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/?f=pjson" width="50%" height="80%" ></iframe>
